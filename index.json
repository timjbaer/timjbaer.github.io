We develop the first formulation of the Awerbuch-Shiloach parallel minimum spanning forest (MSF) algorithm using linear algebra primitives. We introduce a multilinear kernel that operates on an adjacency matrix and two vectors. This kernel updates graph vertices by simultaneously using information from both adjacent edges and vertices. In addition, we explore optimizations to accelerate the shortcutting step in the Awerbuch-Shiloach algorithm. We implement this MSF algorithm with Cyclops, a distributed-memory library for generalized sparse tensor algebra. We analyze the parallel scalability of our implementation on the Stampede2 supercomputer.","tags":[],"title":"Parallel Minimum Spanning Forest Computation using Sparse Matrix Kernels","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628773200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628773200,"objectID":"9d4fa5cb4dc6e9b0ddc227829f0b1ca6","permalink":"https://timjbaer.github.io/talk/c3work/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/c3work/","section":"talk","summary":"C3.ai Plaform Engineering Lunch \u0026 Learn","tags":[],"title":"Python Code Generation \u0026 Distributed Deep Learning Frameworks","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626699600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626699600,"objectID":"256476e9fe8b8d700ac1f313c93921b1","permalink":"https://timjbaer.github.io/talk/c3research/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/c3research/","section":"talk","summary":"C3.ai Plaform Engineering","tags":[],"title":"Graph Algorithms with Sparse Linear Algebra","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607346000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607346000,"objectID":"926571c94abcaddb573166dccc1d5aee","permalink":"https://timjbaer.github.io/talk/cs598evs/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cs598evs/","section":"talk","summary":"Tensor Computations (CS 598) Final Project","tags":[],"title":"Multilinear Operations on Sparse Tensors \u0026 Graphs","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602766800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602766800,"objectID":"9da9e26f5c4d6c8285027a97ebba374b","permalink":"https://timjbaer.github.io/talk/pposs_andoni/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pposs_andoni/","section":"talk","summary":"PPoSS Planning Group","tags":[],"title":"Low Hop Emulators and Uncapacitated Min-Cost Flow","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601557200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601557200,"objectID":"a1f7f64071896f15c5fe6ecf24c3b646","permalink":"https://timjbaer.github.io/talk/reading_andoni/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/reading_andoni/","section":"talk","summary":"UIUC Parallel Algorithms Reading Group","tags":[],"title":"Low Hop Emulators and Uncapacitated Min-Cost Flow","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595941200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595941200,"objectID":"7d83e35dd670bf3d00090329b0f066bc","permalink":"https://timjbaer.github.io/talk/shopical/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/shopical/","section":"talk","summary":"IBM Intern Hackthon 2020","tags":[],"title":"Shopical: Shop Ethical","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554555600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554555600,"objectID":"f843a4a70338dc9f0f8851370f182532","permalink":"https://timjbaer.github.io/talk/stock/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/stock/","section":"talk","summary":"CS @ ILLINOIS Sail 2019","tags":[],"title":"Evolution in the Stock Market","type":"talk"}]
